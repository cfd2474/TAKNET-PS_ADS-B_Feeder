  "release_notes": "CRITICAL FIX: Clean installs now correctly show Tailscale as disabled (was showing enabled even when TAILSCALE_ENABLED=false). CRITICAL FIX: Switching between tailnets now works properly - uses 'tailscale logout' instead of 'tailscale down' to completely disconnect from old tailnet before connecting to new one. Both bugs prevented proper Tailscale configuration."
