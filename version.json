  "release_notes": "SECURITY: Added tailnet validation to prevent connection to wrong Tailscale network. System now verifies DNS suffix (tail4d77be.ts.net) and only uses Tailscale connection if on correct TAKNET-PS tailnet. Wrong tailnet detection shows red error in UI and falls back to public IP connection. Protects against improper auth key installation."
