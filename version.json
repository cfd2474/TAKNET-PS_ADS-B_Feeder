  "release_notes": "MAJOR FEATURE: Full support for FTDI-based Stratux UATRadio devices alongside RTL-SDR dongles. Enhanced detection script finds both RTL-SDR and FTDI devices in unified interface. Setup wizard displays device type badges (RTL-SDR blue, FTDI amber) with hardware-specific constraints (978 MHz only for FTDI, disabled gain control). Config builder generates correct docker-compose with device-specific mappings (USB bus for RTL-SDR, /dev/ttyUSB for FTDI, hackrf driver for FTDI). Seamless multi-SDR support for mixed hardware setups. Backward compatible with RTL-SDR only systems."
