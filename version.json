  "release_notes": "CRITICAL FIX: PiAware now automatically saves generated Feeder ID to .env and starts container. Previously, generated IDs were only shown to user but not saved, causing PiAware to generate a new ID on every restart. Now the ID is saved immediately after generation and PiAware starts with that ID locked in."
