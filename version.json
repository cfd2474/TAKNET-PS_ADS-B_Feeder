  "release_notes": "CRITICAL FIX: Private Tailscale status API now returns 'running' field that JavaScript polling checks for. Previously API returned 'enabled' and 'connected' but JavaScript checked 'data.running', causing false 'container failed to start' errors after 10 seconds even when container was starting successfully. Added comprehensive debug logging throughout enable process. Config rebuild now fails fast with clear error message if it fails. Status detection now properly distinguishes between container not started vs container starting vs container running."
