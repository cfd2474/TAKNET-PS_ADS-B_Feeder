  "release_notes": "CRITICAL FIX: Auth key now written directly into docker-compose.yml instead of using variable substitution. Previous approach used ${PRIVATE_TAILSCALE_KEY:-} which relied on docker-compose reading .env file - this was unreliable. Now config_builder writes actual auth key value directly: TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-xxx. Also added docker compose down before up to force container recreation with new environment. Logs showed interactive login because TS_AUTHKEY was empty - now guaranteed to have value."
