  "release_notes": "CRITICAL FIX: Private Tailscale now uses dedicated progress modal identical to TAKNET-PS Tailscale. Shows real-time connection status during enable/disable/retry operations. Modal displays spinner, status updates, and success/failure messages. Polls connection status every second with 60-second timeout. Prevents user confusion by providing clear visual feedback during connection process. Modal locks screen until operation completes. Matches professional UX of main Tailscale connection flow."
