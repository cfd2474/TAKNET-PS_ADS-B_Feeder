  "release_notes": "BUG FIX: Added missing private Tailscale service to docker-compose generation. Created build_private_tailscale_service function for agency-specific network isolation. Private Tailscale service now properly included with private-tailscale profile. Service enables multi-agency deployments where different agencies can manage hardware via their own secure networks while feeding to central TAKNET-PS aggregator. Complete dual Tailscale architecture now functional."
