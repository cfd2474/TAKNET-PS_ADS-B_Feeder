  "release_notes": "NEW FEATURE: Private Tailscale modal now displays live container logs during connection. Added /api/private-tailscale/logs endpoint that fetches last 100 lines of container output. Logs refresh every second alongside status polling, showing real-time Tailscale authentication process. Expanded modal width to 700px to accommodate log viewer. Auto-scrolls to latest log entries. Essential for debugging timeout/authentication failures - users can now see exact error messages from Tailscale daemon."
