## 🛠️ Requirements

### Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi 3B or newer** (4B recommended for best performance)
- **RTL-SDR USB dongle** (FlightAware Pro Stick or Pro Stick Plus recommended)
- **1090 MHz ADS-B antenna** (outdoor installation preferred)
- **MicroSD card** (16GB minimum, 32GB recommended)
- **Power supply** (5V 2.5A minimum, official Raspberry Pi PSU recommended)

### Software - CRITICAL
- **Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm Lite** (64-bit **strongly** recommended)
  - Download: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/
  - Use **Raspberry Pi Imager** to flash your SD card
  - **Enable SSH** during image creation
  - **Set WiFi credentials** if not using ethernet
  
- **Proper hostname configuration** (see below)
- **Internet connection** (WiFi or Ethernet)

### 🏷️ Hostname Setup - DO THIS FIRST!

**Before running the installer**, set a meaningful hostname for easy identification:

**Recommended naming convention:**
```
adsb-pi-[ZIPCODE]
```

Examples:
- `adsb-pi-92882` (Corona, CA)
- `adsb-pi-10001` (New York, NY)
- `adsb-pi-90210` (Beverly Hills, CA)

**How to set hostname using Raspberry Pi Imager:**
1. Click the gear icon (⚙️) for advanced options
2. Set hostname: `adsb-pi-XXXXX` (replace XXXXX with your zip code)
3. Enable SSH and set your WiFi credentials
4. Flash the SD card

**How to change hostname on existing installation:**
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname adsb-pi-92882
sudo reboot
```

**Why this matters:**
- Your feeder will be identified as `adsb-pi-92882_abc123` on the network
- Makes it easy to identify which physical location each feeder represents
- Essential when managing multiple feeders across different locations
- Helps with troubleshooting and network monitoring

## 📖 Documentation

Before proceeding, review these guides:
- **[QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)** - Fast-track setup guide with detailed steps
- **[DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Complete reference for scaling to multiple feeders

## 🔧 Configuration Information Needed

**Before running the installer**, gather this information:

### 1. Tailscale Authentication (Optional but Recommended)
- **If you have a Tailscale auth key**: Have it ready to paste
- **If you don't have a key**: Press Enter when prompted, you'll authenticate via browser or skip completely.
- Contact [Michael Leckliter](mailto:michael.leckliter@yahoo.com) if you need an auth key

### 2. Geographic Coordinates (REQUIRED)
You'll need your **precise** location for MLAT (multilateration) to work:

- **Latitude** (e.g., `33.834378`)
- **Longitude** (e.g., `-117.573072`)
- **Altitude in meters** (antenna height above sea level, e.g., `395`)

**Finding your coordinates:**
1. Use Google Maps: Right-click your location → Click the coordinates
2. For altitude, use: https://whatismyelevation.com/

> **📏 Critical: Use ANTENNA altitude, not ground elevation!**
>
> Calculate as: **Ground Elevation + Building Height + Mast Height**
>
> Example: Ground = 350m, roof = 15m, mast = 5m → **Total = 370m**

### 3. Pre-Configured Network Settings
These are already set in the installer:
- **Installation Directory**: `/opt/TAK_ADSB/`
- **Aggregator IP**: `100.117.34.88` (Tailscale)
- **Beast Port**: `30004`
- **MLAT Port**: `30105`
- **Remote User**: `remote` (password: `adsb`)
- **SSH Security**: Remote user accessible only from Tailscale network (100.x.x.x)

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

**Only proceed if you have:**
- ✅ Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm Lite installed
- ✅ Hostname set to `adsb-pi-[ZIPCODE]` format
- ✅ SSH access enabled
- ✅ Your geographic coordinates ready
- ✅ Read the requirements above

### Installation Commands

## 📈 Scaling to Multiple Feeders

Each feeder gets a unique name automatically: `hostname_MAC`

**Best Practice - Use Zip Code Naming:**
1. Flash SD card with **Bookworm Lite**
2. Set hostname to `adsb-pi-ZIPCODE` (e.g., `adsb-pi-92882`) **during imaging**
3. Boot Pi and SSH in
4. Run installer
5. Each feeder auto-connects to aggregator
6. **Each feeder gets its own tar1090** at its Tailscale IP
7. **Remote access** available via `ssh remote@[TAILSCALE_IP]` (Tailscale only)
8. **Easy updates** with `adsb-update all` on each feeder

**Example deployment:**
- `adsb-pi-92882` → Corona, CA location
- `adsb-pi-90210` → Beverly Hills, CA location
- `adsb-pi-10001` → New York, NY location

**Access all feeders from the aggregator dashboard:**
- Main stats: `http://104.225.219.254/graphs1090/`
- Click any feeder to see individual stats and coverage

**Monitor bandwidth across all feeders:**
- SSH into each feeder as `remote` user (from Tailscale network)
- Run `vnstat -d` to see 90-day bandwidth history
- Useful for cellular/metered connection planning

**Mass Update Strategy:**
```bash
# SSH into each feeder and run:
adsb-update all

# Or create a script to update all feeders:
for ip in 100.x.x.x 100.y.y.y 100.z.z.z; do
  ssh remote@$ip "adsb-update all"
done
```

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for mass production strategies.

## 🔒 Security

- **Tailscale** provides end-to-end encryption
- **No public ports** exposed
- **Reusable auth keys** for easy deployment
- **SSH restrictions** - Remote user accessible only from Tailscale network (100.x.x.x)
- **Local web interfaces** only accessible via Tailscale network
- **Organized permissions** with dedicated installation directory
- **Automatic updates** keep security patches current

> **🔑 Auth Key Security:** Never commit Tailscale auth keys to public repositories. The installer prompts for the key at runtime for maximum security.

> **👤 Remote User Security:** Default password is `adsb`. Even with known credentials, SSH access is restricted to Tailscale network only. Consider changing the password after installation: `sudo passwd remote`

> **🌐 Network Isolation:** The SSH restriction ensures that even if credentials are compromised, attackers cannot access feeders without being on your private Tailscale network.

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Individual Feeder Monitoring:**
- Check if a specific Pi is receiving aircraft
- Troubleshoot antenna issues at specific locations
- Compare coverage between different sites
- Verify optimal antenna placement
